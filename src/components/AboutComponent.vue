            We desire to honor God in every area of life. Our starting point,
            goal, and motive is the honor of God. This is foundational for
            understanding why we do what we do. It is all about Him, not us. We
            follow Jesus and help others follow Him. We make disciples by
            engaging culture and community, establishing biblical foundations,
            equipping believers to minister, and empowering disciples to make
            disciples.

                Founded in the early 2012, the Christian Mission Church in
                Cordova, Cebu City has a rich history of service and community
                engagement. Initially established as a small chapel, the church
                grew through the dedication of its early members and local
                leaders. Over the decades, it has expanded its mission to
                include various outreach programs and community support
                initiatives. Our history is marked by a commitment to fostering
                spiritual growth, aiding those in need, and creating a nurturing
                environment for all residents of Cordova.
